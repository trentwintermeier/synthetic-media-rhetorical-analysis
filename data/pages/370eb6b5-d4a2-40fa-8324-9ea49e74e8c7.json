We can learn that this account is dedicated solely to AI-generated content, mainly revolving around ICE and MAGA (often switching political sides).The main motivation behind posting these videos is a combination of different factors, mainly economic and political. Posting videos on social media that end up going viral leads to profit, which is a leading motivator behind the creator’s intent. Additionally, the creator wants to spark political turmoil through social media by posting polarizing videos."

The massive volume of this form of digital media does not exist just by chance; as researchers Loni Hagen et al. emphasize, the abundance of AI-generated content on social media stems from its heavily persuasive nature and its ability to be distributed at an “unprecedented scale” (Hagen et al. 1231-1234). Oftentimes, however, AI-generated content is blatant and serves another, more obscure purpose: distribute the material to satisfy the increasingly insatiable demand for rapid entertainment. In this short clip of a school principal defending his students against ICE agents who show up at the school’s doorsteps, content creator Mike Wayne exemplifies both purposes. An incident in January of 2026 highlights the implications of content such as this. Local police of the South Bay/San Jose community had to dispatch officers to calm the people who were anxious about the presence of ICE agents in their neighborhoods. However, it soon came to light that the photos distributed of these “ICE agents” were artificially generated, intending to be a prank. As highlighted by the news article relating this story, “‘Spreading false information causes real fear and harm in our community,’ the Rapid Response Network wrote after dispatching volunteers to check the block” (Ng)."

It is a seemingly ordinary setting, but the presence of ICE agents creates tension because they have become a politically charged issue in the United States. The video likely exists to comment on this political climate. By placing ICE agents in a culturally specific setting, like this Spanish restaurant, the video highlights irony and invites viewers to question the relationship between cultural consumption and ICE. It appears designed to provoke engagement by tapping into ongoing national debates about immigration and identity. Since this is an AI generated video, the creators are not documenting a real event but constructing a simulated scenario meant to resemble reality. By using AI to fabricate a plausible and emotionally charged situation, the video blurs the line between fiction and lived experience. It exists not as journalism, but as a commentary using artificial realism to engage audiences in the broader debate."

The officers claim that their investigation is lawful, but the woman points out that they do not have a warrant and therefore their claim is false. This video aims to demonstrate an example of an average citizen sticking up to the ICE officers. The goal with doing so is not clear from the video alone, but there are some potential theories. One possible motivation for Wayne uploading the video, assuming it is meant to be depicting a real life event, is to show an example of ICE acting outside of the law, in the hopes that they may face consequences for acting against their stated purpose of upholding the law. In the same vein, Wayne may also be trying to encourage and inspire hope in those who wish to resist ICE by showing an elderly woman standing up to ICE, despite likely being less powerful than the officers both in physical terms and in societal position. Lastly, a more cynical, but likely more accurate reason that Wayne uploaded the video is to gain financial and attention benefits that could come from those who have heard about ICE's actions and especially those who have strong opinions on those actions. Regardless of the truthfulness of the video, doing a rhetorical analysis on this video is still a useful exercise as it gives an example of the kind of techniques that could be used to criticize both ICE and the current presidential administration that are calling for and supporting their actions. However, the likely synthetic nature of the video can also provide some insights on how that fact may affect the audience's perception of the video's message and how seriously they take the video should they deem it synthetic."

It depicts these people as the aggressors to the point that the agents have to run away, even running on top of a parked car. The video also seems to imply that because these people are wearing bright coats they are believed to be drag queens. The purpose of this video is to gain followers and engagement. The poster, Mike Wayne, seems to take the side of the public, but generally he makes these videos to get clicks or even negative views. He wants people to watch and share his content, which leads to the spread of misinformation. This video shows how people are spreading AI content that makes the public look like the aggressors. They never show any context before the moment that regular citizens get upset, so it seems as though they are getting mad for no reason. However, based on real life, oftentimes people become defensive when Ice agents are being aggressive. A rhetorical analysis can offer a perspective on how these videos showing a group of people to be the aggressors against ICE agents can be continuing a harmful rhetoric."
