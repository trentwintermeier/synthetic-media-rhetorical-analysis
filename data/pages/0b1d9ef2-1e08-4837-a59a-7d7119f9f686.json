The ad being shown within this video was for the brand SVEDKA and the name of the commercial was “Shake Your Bots Off.” This video introduces a product using two humanoid robots and was an ad that was AI generated which shows the development of AI in media. SVEDKA is a vodka drink which is not usually shown in the Superbowl ads unlike beers, so this may have been viewed as something that shouldn’t be shown on live television. However, by using different rhetorical approaches, it was shown in a way that can be reimagined for all ages. This was especially important because of how SVEDKA “was on a decline according to the chief marketing officer at Sazerac” (Wall Street Journal) ever since they acquired the company. By making an AI ad, it makes it to where the efficiency of reaching the audience increases as click rates increase in the new age of technology (Harvard). The entire point of the ad was to express the importance of going out and having fun with a product that may help stimulate it. It uses different rhetorical approaches such as pathos or ethos to keep the audience engaged. By watching this video, it helps the audience come up with a clear idea of what the product is and does as well as understand the purpose of the video."

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has made several statements about its new AI implementations in precise judging, on-site interactive activities, and marketing. One video in particular had sparked online discourse after being displayed during the opening ceremony. Several users on X have commented on its irony—the Olympics is a \"showcase of human capability,\" and here it is using generative AI—a \"tool that's systematically breaking it\"—in an attempt to celebrate it (LaCapria, 2026). The purpose of the opening ceremony is to introduce the new and returning athletes who will be featured and to get viewers abroad excited. With this AI-generated flashback sequence, the audience is intended to be reminded of past Olympic games and, therefore, inspired. Given that this year's games mark roughly a hundred years since the first Winter Games, reminding the world of their history is especially important. However, this video shows us that using generative AI as a tool prevents these ideas of remembrance, passion, and reverence for past athletes and events from coming through. Viewers can compare this opening ceremony video to other Olympic promotional videos, such as the BBC's \"Trails Will Blaze\" stop-motion video, and clearly see that gen-AI as a medium pales in comparison to human creativity."

          "text": "It was, indeed, a terrible time of the year for McDonald’s Netherlands. The Dutch branch of the American megacorporation would face international criticism after debuting an AI generated ad that flipped the holiday classic, “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year,” into a nag on the season. The video was plagued by uncanny human depictions, packaged with unconvincing physics, and bizarre visuals that bordered on unsettling. The universal disappointment was best captured by this commenter, stating, “Gotta love a bad idea plus a bad execution” (\"THE Infamous AI McDonald's Ad\" 2025). Terrible, indeed; there was nothing here worth celebrating. Ironically, McDonald’s would struggle to find a market that embraced this ad, despite being at the forefront of globalization. The video was scrubbed off the internet, but not before statements were released by both McDonald’s and Sweetshop, the production company behind the ad. Sweetshop had remained defensive of their work, feigning human effort, while McDonald’s US was adamant on deflecting blame onto McDonald’s Netherlands—insisting all stories be addressed to this specific branch (Wilkins). Though while McDonald’s attempted to push past this controversy, many viewers grew curious of “why?” Leading speculation pointed to a “boiling frog” theory, believing AI ads will slowly trickle into our media until they are normalized. Others think McDonald’s Netherlands was a trial run, ordered to run this ad as a test on consumer reception. While both contain validity, the bottom line is a desire for profit. In Generative AI, Media, and Society, by Katalin Feher, the profit incentives of late-stage capitalism converge with promotional media in a very predictable manner. Cheaper, faster, and larger scale optimization requires days, no longer weeks, for content to be produced. The convenience of automated and synthetic media, combined with the increasing indistinguishability between real and generated content, is shifting society into a synthetic ecosystem. While McDonald’s disowns the ad, consumers are careful to note the sinister implications. It warns of a future full of “terrible” times, as we prepare for the rise in synthetic promotional material."
