By skillfully integrating modern slang, he cultivates a relatable persona that resonates deeply with younger demographics. This intentional linguistic shift, which highlights how the specific context sets the tone for user interaction (Thaler et al., 2024), transforms traditional, sterile forecasting into a vibrant, engaging experience. Consequently, the AI successfully captures and maintains audience attention in a saturated digital landscape. This strategic blend of technology and cultural fluency not only humanizes the synthetic interface but also redefines how information is consumed, proving that relatability is the ultimate currency for driving consistent viewer engagement and a sense of trust.

The setup he has with a streamer-like background in the first few seconds transitioning into multiple heat maps of weather events and footage of snow-stricken areas reinforce his aspect of ethos which is important to him to garner views and engagement with the audience. On the other hand, this ethos is important to the audience as a stakeholder as they want to view this video as \"reliable\" for weather news due to worry of actual upcoming weather like the storms in the Northeast US.

By outlining the potential environmental disaster in an urgent voice, the AI weatherman establishes the broader context that justifies his online presence and reasoning behind this video. He frames this environmental situation as significant and immediate, which heightens the video as a whole. Doing this gives his message credibility because real-life weather broadcasts are urgent. The context is about creating a moment that feels serious and worthy of audience attention. \n(EW)"}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Context"}],"uuid":"36683744-6c33-4632-ac62-190be892d661"},{"start_time":186,"end_time":227,"annotation":[{"text":"The AI weatherman's use of \"yo\" and \"I legit wanna see [the comments]\" is very informal and he makes use of exclamations of disbelief to sympathize with possibly the viewer's city that he's covering. This diction, or his informal style of speaking could be an indication that the target audience is young adults and older. Adding onto this, the AI weatherman acts very friendly and asks for viewers to comment their cities again if they are \"seein' any flakes out there, drop it in the comments.\" The rhetorical device of pathos can be at play here since he is engaging with the viewer by sympathizing with their struggles and asking for their comments to up his views and engagement which play hand-in-hand. It's like preying on the heartstrings of people who are worried about the upcoming storms and temperature fluctuations to persuade them to engage.

By blending factual weather data with creative storytelling, the production transforms actual atmospheric occurrences into a compelling narrative. It doesn't just invent catastrophes; it amplifies the intensity of documented storms and climatic shifts to highlight their impact.

By asking this question, he is directly acknowledging the viewers rather than treating them as simply recipients of information. This is shifting the dynamic between the communicator and the audience to an interactive exchange. Inviting the audience to comment fosters a sense of participation, making the audience feel involved in verifying the information provided.
