It is a “terrible time of the year” for the family, as McDonalds Netherlands debuts a holiday ad that attempts to playfully jab at the festivities. They seek to connect with the consumer with what they believe to be a relatable dissatisfaction. It is very clear from the beginning that McDonald’s is trying something different, where along with an unexpected theme, generative AI is utilized."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Exigence"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Stakeholders"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Pathos"},{"category":"Rhetorical Triangle","tag":"Communicator"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Purpose"},{"category":"Expanded Rhetorical Situation","tag":"Context"}],"uuid":"54754f80-6d81-45a2-b468-8f7a33d032b6"},{"start_time":3,"end_time":5,"annotation":[{"text":"Additional cast of upset people singing about how terrible the holidays are. A cyclist with a Christmas tree is seen falling backwards down a snowy uphill road, and caroling troupe are performing in the rain.

Here, McDonald’s is continuing to unite the dissatisfied people of this otherwise happy season, joking with the audience regarding several extreme examples. The funny situations attempt to draw appeal beyond relatedness, as they rely on humor to generate interest in these scenes.

The humor continues, as the beloved holiday magic is introduced and shares this familiar seasonal burden. The frantic and pitchy singing of the toy bear inside the store epitomizes this dependance on lighthearted jabs. Furthermore, there is a logic component for the audience that utilizes universal iconography—like Santa and a Christmas teddy bear gift—to express their point. It proposes, “If the Santa Claus is struggling this holiday, then maybe McDonald’s is right!” Yet, early on, without no definite tie-in or statement, it is easy for the message to feel as an unnecessary attack on the beloved character.

The physics of this launch have a tinge of inaccuracy that throw off the scene. Following his landing, the man joins in on the singing. Again, we feature a humorous situation that corresponds to the borderline slanderous attack that McDonald’s is advocating for. And, if it was not apparent before, the synthetic media attracts attention here for its imprecision—instilling a sour taste in the audience’s mouth that is embellished by the already contentious theme. Although, from McDonald’s optimistic point-of-view, there is a continuous playfulness that they hope is appealing to their audience."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"AI Inaccuracies"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Pathos"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Logos"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Message"}],"uuid":"681e40c9-aed9-47e8-a3cc-db1e17d600a6"},{"start_time":13,"end_time":20,"annotation":[{"text":"We see a montage of additional physical chaos, from slipping on ice, to slipping off a roof mid-decoration, to a fire erupting during dinner. The scale and type of disaster is embellishing an already obvious point about the ad—that there is a target audience of adults ranging from 20 to 30. Because we see activities that range from homeowner hassles to bodily harm, can assume an age range that is familiar with both. Furthermore, the Dutch landscape and weather is easily identifiable, and coincides with the region that this ad was released in. The ad carries the same sentiment regarding holiday toil in a slapstick way."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Audience"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Message"}],"uuid":"df896677-ad96-48e0-a439-59d123f676b6"},{"start_time":21,"end_time":22,"annotation":[{"text":"The holiday cookies join in on the singing, with many burnt, showing that even this festive tradition--holiday baking—is often disorganized and upsetting. It further instills the correlation being made between the holidays and the \"terrible\" times that plague the season, according to McDonald’s. Again, McDonald’s continues their attempts at cracking jokes that fall short in face of a glaring omission in consumer desires. Not only is there a misunderstanding of the potent holiday spirit, that McDonald’s would later admit to in a later statement, but a general disinterest with synthetic media. The silliness of the cookies is apparent, and so are the intentions of the ad, but do not fall into place."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Logos"},{"category":"Expanded Rhetorical Situation","tag":"Context"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Audience"}],"uuid":"f3d008f1-d59b-4c27-8a1f-b3552d5b3014"},{"start_time":22,"end_time":26,"annotation":[{"text":"This next scene has since become the embodiment of the ad, showing a bizarre fisheye lens shot of two grandparents getting very close and personal with their grandson—all the while exposing their mouths and teeth. It is a very grotesque look that incites visceral disgust from many of the audience. This scene would face the most widespread criticism, specifically regarding the uncanny scenes of open-mouthed grandparents. Of these comments were concerns with the obviously AI generated content, while others, simply, were grossed out.

The chorus, \"It's the most terrible time of the year\" repeats as to highlight this point. It is a logos appeal that is once again continued in this video, as we see more instances of disaster being attributed to the holidays. A connection is intended to be made between the viewer and the communicator as not only are they intended to laugh but relate to the intensity of the season.

We finally see a payout for all the opinionated buildup, portraying McDonald’s as a happy place. There is a clear correlation between creating a pleasant holiday experience and attending the restaurant. In this scene McDonald’s involves their audience as stakeholders, stating that McDonald’s could be an escape from the often-disastrous season. The man in the scene is meant to embody that audience, being 20-something year old Dutch adults.

It further reinstates that there is a designated audience that is local to the region—and is predominately white. We also get another look at the contribution that McDonald’s is making during the holidays. The tranquility and pleasure that is conveyed is achieved through the restaurant, as it is apparently unable to be found anywhere else.

A Dutch phrase, translating to “December could use a little McDonald’s” flashes on the screen. This is the tie-in, as we converge all these preceding disasters into a simple tag line and visual that attempts to evoke familiarity.

It is a global image that is extremely familiar across culture and continent and is perhaps their most powerful appeal. It produces an image synonymous with joy—in part due to their infamous Happy Meal branding. The end placement suggests that the last moment the viewer shares with the ad should be recognizing McDonald’s as the titan of a brand that it is. It forces the audience to recall who they are, and their image as a restaurant in pursuit of great memories, not just good food.
