Immediately, his role as a former president contributes greatly to the audiences’ perceived sense of his character and credibility. His reputation as a known political figure and trusted leader lets viewers know that he is a figure of authority and is credible and trustworthy, since he was already in a role of power and leadership before. The use of Obama’s character reinforces trust in the video’s original intended message, even if the actual deepfake video is synthetic. Audience viewers likely believed the video at first but then were shocked by what Obama said in the video, and then learned that the video was a deepfake when Peele revealed it."}],"tags":[{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Ethos"}],"uuid":"b328d538-2caa-4ebd-b753-3ca48053f7a0"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":10,"annotation":[{"text":"Here, logos functions through the video’s demonstration rather than through explicitly arguing to show the logical appeals. By showing a realistic video of Obama supposedly speaking, the video demonstrates that synthetic media can deceive even the most attentive of viewers. Peele is able to appeal to the logical perspective of audiences by using the logical connection of showing the realistic video and then revealing that it was deepfaked to illustrate his point that we should not believe in everything we see online. In the video, Obama also appears to be saying “if someone wanted to make me say something, they could” which is literally revealing it right to the audiences that Obama’s image is being manipulated."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Logos"}],"uuid":"08aaf86a-4e1a-4298-bfe3-fbc0592eb4ab"},{"start_time":19,"end_time":29,"annotation":[{"text":"Like the Anderson Cooper example, the video appeals to emotion by creating fear, concern, and unease. Seeing a familiar and respected figure manipulated evokes a strong emotional reaction about the reliability of the media people view and consume. Viewers were likely initially shocked by the video, believing that it was Obama who actually said the offensive and harsh words stated in the video at first. Viewers could have also been upset or even angered by the deepfake of Obama, especially since he is a political figure and audience viewers can be divided based on political affiliation and beliefs. It is likely that when it was revealed that the entire video was synthetic, viewers felt fear at what deepfake technologies could be capable of and are likely to be more wary of what they believe in."}],"tags":[{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Pathos"}],"uuid":"c74480b2-07bb-4add-8286-3a1225ec7cba"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":15,"annotation":[{"text":"The intended audience is the general public, especially internet users who watch familiar figures online. The choice of Obama signals that the content targets broad viewers who recognize him and may suspend disbelief because of his authority. To be more specific, we can infer that the intended audience is anyone who might watch political news and keep up with politics. Audience viewers who are more politically involved or hold certain political beliefs may be more likely to click on the video or want to watch the video than people that are not as involved in America’s politics. We can also infer that the audience may be anyone who is more on social media, since videos like these are likely to go viral due to the figure in the video."}],"tags":[{"category":"Rhetorical Triangle","tag":"Audience"}],"uuid":"b61a2c5b-43fa-4179-8e83-e875544237ae"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":10,"annotation":[{"text":"The implicit message warns about how realistic deepfakes can be, by demonstrating one with a trusted political figure. Like other deepfakes, it functions to make viewers question the authenticity of what they see online. In the video, the explicit message Peele communicates is warning people against believing everything they see online and on the Internet. Peele explicitly states, even as Obama, that people need to “rely on trusted news sources” especially in this new age of information, disinformation, and deepfake technology. By using the deepfake video of Obama speaking, Peele warns that deepfake technology will only get better as time goes on, and it will become even more imperative for audiences to be wary of what they believe in.

The creator uses Obama’s widely recognized identity to transfer perceived credibility to the message. In this case, we can argue that the “real” communicator here is the creator, Jordan Peele. Peele is the one who is actually speaking, as the deepfake was created by overlaying Peele’s mouth movements onto Obama’s facial expressions.

The motivating force behind the creation of the video was likely due to deepfake technology becoming better, more realistic, and more accessible, and how these factors could lead to the misuse of deepfake technology, especially when used to manipulate videos of influential political figures like Obama.

The video was created by Jordan Peele using deepfake technology where it allowed Peele to transfer his own facial movements and speaking voice to Obama’s face, making it look like Obama spoke. The purpose of the video was to illustrate the abilities of deepfake technology, what they can be used for, and warns audience viewers not to be deceived by everything they see online and through social media.

The implicit purpose behind the video could also be to demonstrate how good the deepfake technology was back then.
