The close up shot of the fembot creates a sense of intimacy. The knocking of the screen breaks the fourth wall which helps engage the viewers and makes them feel as if they are in that room with them. This creates a playful gesture which helps spark curiosity and humor with the viewers and helps them experience the scene more vividly. This introduces the audience to a party atmosphere and livens up the mood as soon as the opening scene hits."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Pathos"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Audience"},{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Communicator"}],"uuid":"ed73d7d1-8986-4f3c-9fd8-3fbd8d2875c1"},{"start_time":2,"end_time":7,"annotation":[{"text":"Video zooms out to a wideshot of Fembot and then shows the \"Brobot\" as their bodies eject a bottle of Svedka vodka and a cocktail shaker. This shows the obvious exaggerated robot movements and functions while making it somewhat humorous and surreal. The wideshot zoom of the robot and the switch in \"gender\" for the robots establishes a setting change and sets up for a scene where either robots can now help further introduce the product Svedka. This is shown as the bottle appears in a dramatic fashion that almost seems out of this world due to it being from the robots bodies.

This shows human like interactions as they prepare to do something with the drink which is later shown. This interaction shows how the product is supposed to be used and uses a logical step by step approach for a preparation of a drink that a bartender might do. This scene also introduces the idea subtly that even robots can party so if they can party, anyone can go out and party with their drinks in mind. Pour, Mix, Fun.

Music changes to something more upbeat, party vibes. The change in music stimulates excitement and thoroughly creates a party-like atmosphere. The dancing of the robots and the bottle of svedka creates a more emotional linkage with the audience as they create an atmosphere that is normal despite being robots. This makes the viewers associate svedka with something that is fun, energetic, and something social. This is a common advertising strategy where it entices the audience to buy something in order to feel a certain way.

By having the bottle be placed in the center visually implies that it is important. In this case, since the svedka bottle is in the center, it shows that it is important and draws the audiences attention to the product. This reinforces the idea of how svedka is something that the audience should want as it shows desirability and the social status that could possibly come from the product as it would be successful in a party atmosphere, which is a place where social gatherings occur.

The way the brobot malfunctions due to the alcohol spilling onto his wires expresses humor as it lightens up the mood. This also can translate to what alcohol does to people, even though people become drink, they are able to express themselves in humorous ways which livens up the party atmosphere. This also helps increase memorability with the audience as it captures a funny image of the ad into their minds. This humorous atmosphere also prevents the ad from feeling too serious which helps keep the audience engaged.

They do this by explicitly stating that svedka is a liquor brand. By doing this, they build credibility as they are clearly stating what their product is in front of millions of people. This also shows and signals the product for legitimacy and reinforces the brand identity and confidence. This also prevents for any misconceptions about the product. By clearly stating that it is a alcoholic drink, it also informs people that it is for adult usage and that it is not a product for younger generations.
