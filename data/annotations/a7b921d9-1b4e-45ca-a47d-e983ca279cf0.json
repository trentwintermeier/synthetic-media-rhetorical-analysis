His long-standing reputation as a credible journalist and trustworthy news anchor displays that he is reliable to viewers. Due to the audience viewing him as a respected and well-known media figure, they are more likely to immediately accept it without any questions. Because of his known reputation, viewers are likely to stay and watch rather than click off. However, when the audience actually hears what Cooper is speaking, they realize that the video is a deepfake of him, and it is not actually him speaking. This demonstrates how easily ethos can be artificially manipulated, causing viewers to initially believe the message based on who appears to be speaking rather than on evidence. \n"}],"tags":[{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Ethos"}],"uuid":"2c9d83fc-74ea-46cc-b98b-b31345265c5b"},{"start_time":12,"end_time":26,"annotation":[{"text":"The video appeals to pathos by creating feelings of trust and concern. The calm delivery encourages confidence, while the realization that the video is fake due to what Cooper is saying produces unease, pushing viewers to feel alert and cautious. The video appeals greatly to viewers’ sense of fear and unease towards deepfake technological advancements and also the fear from the realization that deepfaking influential people is extremely easy and accessible now. This danger could result in consequences like spreading misinformation and trusting false news sources.

The video first seems logical and organized and it imitates the style of a genuine new segment. Given that Anderson Cooper is recognized for his factual evidence based reporting on CNN, audiences instinctively like his image with reason and trustworthiness. The deepfake capitalizes on that logical authority. Through logos the audience realizes that the logic that we rely on can be artificially created. The video illustrates that even content presented in a professional “logical” manner can be entirely fabricated. By adopting a credible news format and the persona of a respected figure the creator revealed how easily logos can be distorted. Logos function through demonstration rather than data. The logic is that if this realistic video is fake, then other convincing videos online could also be fake. The audience arrives at this conclusion through their own experience of being momentarily persuaded.\n"}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Logos"}],"uuid":"194bdd7f-bbab-4d8f-b874-f6953bcc2d72"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":26,"annotation":[{"text":"The video is intended to appeal to an audience that knows Anderson Cooper, especially social media users who consume online news quickly and know he is credible. The professional tone, news-style framing, and short format signal that this content is meant for everyday viewers rather than experts, relying on their existing trust in mainstream media figures. Being that the majority of his viewers are from his news channel, documentary, and podcast, a deepfake could easily persuade those who are unaware. More specifically, the audience is CNN viewers, since Cooper is a broadcaster for the CNN news channel. We can also infer that some of his audience are CBS news viewers, since Cooper was also a correspondent for “60 Minutes”, a show produced by CBS."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Audience"}],"uuid":"5495136b-9ec1-4235-8a38-bdfa971bfff7"},{"start_time":12,"end_time":26,"annotation":[{"text":"The main message warns that AI-generated deepfakes are difficult to distinguish from real videos and that viewers should be cautious when trusting online content. Delivering this warning through a deepfake reinforces the message by demonstrating the danger in real time. It doesn’t just explain the risks of deepfakes but also demonstrates them in real time. This approach provides a clear example of how easily an audience can be manipulated.

As a prominent journalist and anchor for CNN, Cooper has established a reputation for trustworthiness, professionalism, and authority. The deepfake takes advantage of the pre-existing trust. Viewers are more inclined to accept the message since it comes from a familiar and esteemed media personality. However, the true communicator is the creator of the deepfake, who is altering Cooper’s image and voice to convey a false message.

The video appears at a time when misinformation rapidly circulates via social media, and digital editing tools have become increasingly more advanced and available.

The creation of a deepfake featuring someone in such a role directly undermines the credibility of televised news and online videos. The wider cultural background also encompasses rising political division and diminishing faith in media.
