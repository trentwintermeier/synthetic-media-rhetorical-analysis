And everybody believed us.” This immediately positions the global audience as the primary stakeholder. This video is creating a power imbalance between the creators and the audience. It is framing the creators as deceptive and portraying the public as easily influenced and naive. This section of the video is very deceptive because it claims the world is being fooled by the man of the moon, but in reality, the entire thing, including the interviewees, is fake. This rhetorical appeal highlights how easily authority can shape public belief, even when the information presented is entirely fake.

By flashing the cameras they had with them, he strengthens his ethos and presents himself as a reliable, firsthand source. The mention of physical evidence makes his claim appear more legitimate and trustworthy to the audience. This rhetorical move is persuasive because it appeals to the assumption that physical proof means truth. However, there is a lot of irony in this, and the evidence meant to confirm his credibility is part of the entire fabricated narrative. This demonstrates how easily ethos can be made through strategic visuals.

The exigence driving the creation of this video is most likely moon landing conspirators that believe the moon landing was fake, and they want to spread their nonsense with AI tools at hand that are easily made with quality not easily discernable by a glancing eye. According to a storyboard on Google Arts and Culture provided by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, there’s an increasing number of doubters of the moon landing due to younger generations forgetting the lunar accomplishments and the growing sea of contemporary information and data that makes it difficult for folks to discern truth from lies. This latter fact is heavily demonstrated in this very video which was created synthetically via AI.

The speaker \"Murray\" frames the scene as eerie and suspicious by emphasizing that the caller refuses to identify himself because \"that's not important,\" and then immediately describes the moon as looking like \"sh*t.\" This detail gives this clip a mysterious tone and signals that something is off. This clip situates the story in a context of conspiracy and doubt about the moon landing.

The moon landing was back in 1969, so the video using older folk as \"witnesses\" to what the moon \"actually\" looked like could convince a viewer what they're saying is true. Older folk also tend to just carry credibility because with age comes wisdom, so this can add onto their ethos as communicators of their message that the moon landing was fake. Altogether, the use of older, seemingly credible “witnesses” to a bygone era of space exploration and fast paced video format with dramatic effects would be very convincing to a younger viewer or someone who is not well versed in science, as these types of people would have a harder time believing in the moon landing that happened decades ago.

The commercial uses a vintage aesthetic to convince the audience that with Kling anything is possible, even faking the moon landing. Although the Medium is a commercial or digital media it doesn't fail to appear real, I verified that the Ai video used accurate dates by crosschecking on the NASA website and it reassured the date of 1969 as the first moon landing. Overall the purpose of this spoof and funny theorized crazed video is too convince the audience to use its Ai that is only mentioned in the end.
