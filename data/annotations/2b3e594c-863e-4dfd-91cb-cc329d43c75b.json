His reputation as a credible entrepreneur signals trustworthiness and intellectual prowess, causing viewers to want to stay and watch the rest of the video to see what he says. However, many people are divided on their opinion of Zuckerberg, which can affect whether or not they believed the video initially. Those who distrust and criticize Zuckerberg might believe in the video, using it to say “I knew it” instead of actually trusting in the credibility of the source. Others might be more wary, especially since it seems less credible or trustworthy that such an influential person like Zuckerberg would openly admit to Facebook’s criticisms."}],"tags":[{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Ethos"}],"uuid":"3b44c1b4-225c-4c0c-8aab-6a65760d00b1"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":18,"annotation":[{"text":"There was not really a blatant example of a logos appeal in the video. However, we can argue that the logos appeal worked through the video’s demonstration. The logic is that if this realistic video is fake, then other convincing videos online could also be fake. The audience draws this conclusion based on their personal experience of fleeting persuasion, even if they initially believed the shocking video to be true since Zuckerberg is such a prominent and influential figure. Posters also can appeal to audiences’ sense of logic because the video points out Facebook’s hypocrisy in regards to how they claim they take down false posts. This deepfake video is still up today on Instagram, illustrating flaws in Meta’s logic and claims of transparency."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Logos"}],"uuid":"9cbc2aa6-a2ea-408a-8007-5c3117baf3a5"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":8,"annotation":[{"text":"The video appeals to the audiences’ emotional appeals especially in the beginning, where Zuckerberg seems to directly voice common concerns over Facebook’s extensive data collection and access. Many people are concerned with their data privacy and there seems to be growing distrust in large corporations, social media platforms, and institutions that collect your data and track you. By having Zuckerberg seem to directly address many common criticisms of Facebook, Posters is able to elicit emotional reactions in viewers and raise feelings of distrust, unease, and maybe even anger over their data privacy. Even the choice of deepfaking Zuckerberg is a pathos appeal itself, as people are quite divided on their opinion of him, especially since he is so powerful and has so much control over many things."}],"tags":[{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Pathos"}],"uuid":"2e037fec-a32c-4e94-a1f6-f41c30e7220b"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":18,"annotation":[{"text":"The intended audience is the general public, especially social media users who consume online news quickly. Since the video was posted on Facebook and Instagram, the audience would definitely be Facebook and Instagram users. We infer that a more narrow audience would be people who are concerned about Meta and Facebook’s data collection policies, as that is the initial message Zuckerberg is communicating in the beginning of the deepfake video which could catch the attention of this certain audience. People who are displeased with Facebook’s policies over false posts or maybe even displeased with Zuckerberg in general are more likely to stay and watch the video, due to phenomena like confirmation bias."}],"tags":[{"category":"Rhetorical Triangle","tag":"Audience"}],"uuid":"81b2cac7-cdf4-4e2c-bccd-c186e8c1872f"},{"start_time":0,"end_time":8,"annotation":[{"text":"The video is almost ironic as Zuckerberg is seen opening up with statements like saying “imagine one person who has control over all this data”, most likely referring to himself. The creator is clearly poking criticism at Zuckerberg and at Facebook’s data collection policies. The main message that Posters was trying to convey is to criticize large corporations’ data collection and data privacy issues, as well as to point out the hypocrisy in Facebook’s policies of transparency and claims against spreading false posts and misinformation after they refused to take down a doctored video of Nancy Pelosi. Posters’ message in the video is to criticize Facebook’s data collection policies and criticize Zuckerberg’s immense power over and access to peoples’ data.

By using a well-known entrepreneur’s likeness, Posters is able to reach quite a wide audience due to Zuckerberg’s fame and reputation. Additionally, having Zuckerberg say things like “whoever controls the data controls the future”, possibly referring to Meta’s extensive data collection, is more likely to elicit stronger reactions within the audience. Posters originally created the video in response to Facebook’s refusal to take down a doctored video of Nancy Pelosi. Posters also intended for the video to be a part of a larger digital media art exhibit, which is meant to provide commentary on society’s famous and influential figures and also on changing technology and how that affects us.

The video points out Facebook’s hypocrisy when it comes to their policies regarding false posts and posts that spread misinformation, especially since the deepfake was not taken down. The exigence can also be seen as the growing threat of massive corporations like Meta/Facebook and how much power they have, especially over peoples’ data and privacy. Posters creates urgency in the video by having Zuckerberg seemingly criticize Facebook himself and directly point out concerns over data privacy. The video also creates a sense of urgency by suggesting that influential figures can be deepfaked so easily, emphasizing the importance of skepticism and media literacy."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Exigence"}],"uuid":"e10eeb6c-3378-47d7-a1b5-b37a218b9710"},{"start_time":11,"end_time":18,"annotation":[{"text":"The video was made in response and as a way to protest Facebook’s seemingly hypocritical policies regarding misinformation and false posts when Facebook refused to initially take down a doctored video of House speaker Nancy Pelosi.
