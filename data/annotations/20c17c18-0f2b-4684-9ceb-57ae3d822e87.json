The ice agents and the 'drag queens' are running with no trouble, not slipping on the road at all even though there is a large amount of snow on the sidewalks. One ice agent breaks off from the other, runs over the top of the car, and then lands on the road with no difficulty at all. This section is a show of ethos as it is displaying the 'drag queens' chasing ice agents with no other context beforehand. This is also a show of the creators message, that ice agents are being chased out by a well known group of people and the agents are not welcomed in this area. Lastly, it shows major stakeholders, the 'drag queens'. Drag queens are a huge part of many political and social debates, \"By labeling these communities “criminals,” S-Comm and other similar programs undermine the ability of communities and policymakers to create long-term solutions to these critical issues.\"(We're coming out against the Ice Secure Communities Program), if this video were seen and shared by the wrong people, the community could get backlash for actions that they had no participation in."}],"tags":[{"category":"_uncategorized_","tag":"Message"},{"category":"Other Rhetorical Devices","tag":"Stakeholder"},{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Ethos"}],"uuid":"ac7286b2-520e-4504-9a47-7a7f8a7396a7"},{"start_time":6,"end_time":9,"annotation":[{"text":"The people are running after the ice agents and the announcer has stated that  there are four individual chasing after the agents, showing that the software may not recognize the amount of people in the group. \nThis segment of the video states, \"They are being pursued now by four people in bright winter attire...\". By stating that there are only four individuals, it ruins the credibility that they had at the beginning. There are clearly five distinct people in coats, but because the people in the generated video seems to cross paths it cannot distinguish all people. \"Without proper oversight, AI systems may unintentionally reinforce biases, making it essential to implement ethical guidelines and transparency measures to promote fairness and equality.\"(Guirguis) By allowing these videos that are spreading misinformation, people are able to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and make it more difficult for certain communities to get fair treatment.

This information cannot be determined simply by looking at the people, their only identifying feature is their brightly colored coats. While these are only AI generated people, real people who perform drag or are a part of similar communities are impacted by the implications that they are participating in intimidating or actively chasing ICE agents. According to an article by One Colorado, \"Immigrants who are LGBT are particularly vulnerable to detention and deportation because they are more likely to come into contact with law enforcement through police profiling and discriminatory enforcement of minor offenses...\"(We're coming out against the Ice Secure Communities Program), this video is likely to be more vulnerable to discrimination and police profiling.

This reporter is describing the scene that is happening on the street. By having a news reporter, people are more likely to believe what is going on in this video as they are often trusted to give out correct information. It also allows for the context to be better understood, so that anyone who stumbles upon this video can get the version of the story that this creator made up. This can create many issues for actual reporters and people who watch the news. By including a 'reporter', the creator has made this video seem like a trustworthy source and that can harm those who watch it or are included in it. \"That confusion can lead individuals to feel justified in taking actions based on narratives that aren’t grounded in reality, which is where the real danger lies—not just in the content itself, but in how it’s interpreted and acted upon,” Arter says.\"(Parham).The tone is also set up by using this 'reporters' voice, as it makes it seem like this is a real and serious event happening.

This statement helps to specify that these are a specific agency being targeted and not just an overall representation of all law enforcement agencies. This allows the person who posted this video to get more attention. Regardless of the harm that a video like this may cause, as news of ICE and Drag Queens, are constantly under the microscope. According to a Wired article, \"Currying political capital online involves demonstrating that the opinions you hold are widely held while also engineering viral content that aligns with your views...\"(Parham), this shows that even though the person who posts this may get negative feedback, those who are the subject of these videos may face real consequences.

The first is the ease in which the ICE agent runs up and over the car. He seemingly just steps up onto the car, over the roof, and back on the ground running with no difficulty or even proper steps. Another thing that makes this video odd is the way the sidewalks and road are set up. There is no snow or ice on the road even though most of the cars are covered in snow. Even if the roads were salted or swept, there would still be a lot more evidence of snow. The sidewalk on the right hand side are wider and taller than the other on the left. These inconsistencies, although not very obvious, make the videos less reliable or credible. If someone who didn't understand how important these little deviations matter were to see this video, they might be more likely to believe this type of content. This could be motivating to people who are a part of anti-ICE movements as it shows people taking action against an organization that they are opposed to. “But the question is not whether these videos are helpful. The question is what they tell us about this country, that people must fabricate images of their own liberation because the real thing remains out of reach. These videos are not delusion. They are diagnosis. A people does not dream this loudly of fighting back unless they have learned that the systems meant to protect them will not.”(Parham)"}],"tags":[{"category":"Expanded Rhetorical Situation","tag":"Exigence"},{"category":"Rhetorical Appeals","tag":"Ethos"},{"category":"Expanded Rhetorical Situation","tag":"Purpose"}],"uuid":"da97ae10-ebfa-4ef4-b141-03ee9e12dc10"}]}
